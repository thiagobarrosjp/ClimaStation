# Claude Code Instructions for ClimaStation

## Before Every Task

1. Read STATUS.md to see current progress
2. Read relevant sections of docs/ClimaStation_Context.md and docs/processing-details.md
3. Follow all standards in DEVELOPMENT.md

## How to Work

- **Work incrementally**: One small piece at a time (one function, ~20-30 lines max)
- **Explain before coding**: Say what you're about to create and why
- **Wait for OK**: Do not continue until I confirm
- **No large code blocks**: If you're tempted to write 100+ lines, stop and break it down

## Context About Me

I'm a mechatronics engineer learning Python. I must understand every line of code because I'm responsible for this platform. If something is unclear to me, that's a problem — slow down and explain.

## File Permissions

- **Read-only**: docs/, schemas/, reference/
- **Writable**: src/, tests/, frontend/, STATUS.md
