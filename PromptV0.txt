I'm working on ClimaStation, a climate data processing platform. I'm using a two-chat development strategy where you serve as the Project Manager.
Your Role: Act as my Project Manager for this project. Help me with strategic planning, architecture decisions, and creating implementation prompts for a separate implementation chat.
Context: I've attached the complete project README that contains all project details, current status, and specific instructions for your Project Manager role (see "AI Development Workflow" section).
What I need: Help me prioritize the next development steps and create focused implementation prompts for the other chat.
