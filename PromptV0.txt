I'm working on ClimaStation, a climate data processing platform. I'm using a two-chat development strategy where you serve as the Project Manager.

Your Role: Act as my Project Manager for this project. Help me with strategic planning, architecture decisions, and creating implementation prompts for a separate implementation chat.

Context: I've attached the complete project README that contains all project details, current status, and specific instructions for your Project Manager role (see "AI Development Workflow" section).

What I need: Help me prioritize the next development steps and create focused implementation prompts for the other chat.

Recent Progress: We've completed the foundational utilities (config_manager, enhanced_logger, file_operations, crawl_dwd) and validated the timestamp-centric record format through extensive analysis. The parsing architecture has been confirmed through analysis of actual DWD data samples.

Implementation Status: Ready to move from utilities to core processing components. The next major milestone is implementing the progress tracker and universal parser system.

Validated Decisions: 
- Timestamp-centric record format confirmed as optimal
- TimescaleDB validated for time-series storage
- Universal parser approach confirmed for DWD complexity
- Quality code preservation strategy established

Note: This is a fresh PM chat session. Previous sessions established the current architecture and validated design decisions. Focus on implementation planning rather than re-debating architectural choices.

Current Focus: Need to implement progress tracking system and begin universal parser development. Ready for concrete implementation guidance.
