# ClimaStation Deployment Scripts

This directory contains deployment and production management scripts for the ClimaStation project.

## Purpose

Deployment scripts handle:
- Production environment setup
- Database deployment and migrations
- Configuration management for different environments
- Health checks and monitoring setup
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Planned Scripts

### Environment Setup
- `deploy_production.py` - Deploy to production environment
- `setup_monitoring.py` - Configure monitoring and alerting
- `configure_environment.py` - Set up environment-specific configurations

### Database Management
- `backup_database.py` - Create database backups
- `restore_database.py` - Restore from backups
- `migrate_production.py` - Run production database migrations
- `verify_data_integrity.py` - Validate data consistency

### Health Checks
- `health_check.py` - Comprehensive system health validation
- `performance_monitor.py` - Monitor system performance metrics
- `validate_pipeline.py` - End-to-end pipeline validation

### Maintenance
- `cleanup_old_data.py` - Archive and clean up old processing data
- `optimize_database.py` - Database maintenance and optimization
- `rotate_logs.py` - Log file management and rotation

## Usage

Deployment scripts should be run with appropriate permissions:

\`\`\`bash
# Example usage (when scripts are implemented)
python scripts/deployment/health_check.py --environment production
python scripts/deployment/backup_database.py --output /backup/location
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

Deployment scripts must:
- Handle sensitive configuration data securely
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Implement proper access controls
- Log security-relevant events
- Validate input parameters thoroughly

## Environment Configuration

Scripts should support multiple environments:
- `development` - Local development environment
- `staging` - Pre-production testing environment  
- `production` - Live production environment

## Integration

All deployment scripts should:
- Use the existing `config_manager` for environment-specific settings
- Integrate with `enhanced_logger` for audit trails
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Provide detailed success/failure reporting
- Include rollback capabilities where appropriate

## Contributing

When adding new deployment scripts:
1. Consider security implications carefully
2. Include comprehensive error handling
3. Add appropriate logging and monitoring
4. Test thoroughly in staging environment first
5. Document any manual steps required
6. Update this README with script descriptions
