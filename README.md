ClimaStation Germany-focused web platform that makes DWD's historical climate data instantly discoverable, offering faceted and map-based search, quick previews, and both one-click and custom downloads (CSV/NetCDF/JSON), plus a RESTful API. It serves casual users with interactive charts and power users with bulk, automated access and pre-processed summaries like climatologies and anomalies. Well, it will do all that, Now I'm still in the planning and backend developing stage.

Additionally, because ClimaStation is built with future expansion in mind, all DWD data currently lives under a dedicated data/germany/ folder. As we onboard new sources, say MeteoSwiss, KNMI, or NOAA archives, each with its own directory layout and metadata conventions, we'll mirror that appraoch by creating country-specific subfolders (e.g. data/switzerland/, data/netherlands/). Our pipeline modules will remain specialized: the DWD crawler and parser operate exclusively on data/germany/, while new crawler/parser components for other providers can be developed independently against their own folders. This keeps each source's logic isolated and the overall structure clear, even as we integrate datasets whose formats and schemas are not yet known. 

The DWD “observations\_germany/climate/” repository is substantial. For example, the 10-minute air-temperature folder alone holds 1 622 ZIP archives (each unpacking to \~300 000 lines of raw text), and we’ll find equivalent volumes for hourly, daily, grid fields, derived parameters, etc.  Compressed, we’re looking at tens of gigabytes; uncompressed (and once we add metadata and other timescales) easily 100 GB+ of files to download, parse, and stage.

My plan to pull all of that into a Hetzner CPX21 (3 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 80 GB SSD) as a starting point means:

* Streaming & chunked parsing are a must: read line-by-line (or in small batches), avoid in-memory load of whole files, and write out partial JSONL segments.
* Parallel processing where possible: split the job across multiple processes or threads to utilize all vCPUs, but watch your RAM footprint.
* Efficient PostgreSQL loading: use `COPY` from CSV/JSONL, disable indexes during bulk load, then re-index.

Because this is a one-off bulk import of historic data, consider temporarily renting a few larger instances (e.g. 8–16 vCPU, 32 GB RAM) or spinning up multiple CPX21 workers in parallel. Once the initial import is done and the data reside in PostgreSQL, day-to-day updates (e.g. the small “now” and “recent” folders) will be far lighter and easily handled by your base server.

Additionally, because the DWD continuously publishes new observations, ClimaStation will need an ongoing update pipeline alongside the one-off historic import. After the initial bulk download and PostgreSQL load, we’ll schedule a lightweight updater (or even a separate micro-pipeline) to regularly fetch new “now” and “recent” files from the DWD repository, parse them incrementally, and `COPY` them into our database. The cadence of these updates (hourly, daily, weekly) can be tuned based on data volume and freshness requirements, and if needed we can spin up additional Hetzner instances temporarily to parallelize both historic and incremental parsing without impacting our production server.

And because I'm a one-person team (a mechatronics engineer leveraging AI assistance rather than a full dev squad), every step—from downloading to parsing to database loading—must be fully automated with as little hands-on work as possible. You’ll build end-to-end scripts (and even a separate update pipeline) that:

* Stream and chunk raw archives without ever loading entire files into memory.
* Run checksum and line-count validations after each parse to guarantee that every parsed record corresponds exactly to the original input.
* Log and alert on any mismatches so you can catch errors early.

By keeping a complete local copy of all DWD files, you retain the ability to re-validate your parsing logic at any time—replaying tests on historic data whenever you tweak the parser—to ensure your PostgreSQL tables always mirror the source data with 100 % fidelity.

We maintain a JSONL manifest at `data/germany/dwd_urls.jsonl`, where each line is an object with:

{
  "url": "https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/ten-minute/air_temperature/",
  "contains": [".zip", ".txt"],
  "estimated_files": 1622
}

This file is a snapshot of a subset of the DWD repository’s folder structure and simply serves as an example. It does not represent the entire archive. As you onboard additional folders (e.g. hourly, daily, grid products), you can extend this manifest with new entries following the same schema.

Dataset folder pattern:
Most DWD datasets follow a four-folder convention under each parameter directory:

* `recent/` – the latest complete snapshot (raw data)
* `history/` – the bulk archive of past observations (raw data)
* `now/` – high-frequency, rolling updates (raw data)
* `metadata/` – station definitions, schema files, quality-flag conventions
Three of these contain raw measurement files, while `metadata/` holds the descriptive information needed to interpret them.

Current testing focus:
 We’re initially validating our end-to-end parser on the `10_minutes_air_temperature/history` dataset. Once that pipeline proves reliable, we’ll run it against the real-world archives in the other parameter folders (e.g. hourly, daily, grid products).
