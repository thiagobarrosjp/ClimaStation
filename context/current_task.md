# Current Development Phase: Progress Tracking & Core Processing Pipeline

## Project Status (Updated 2025-07-24)
- âœ… Foundational utilities completed (config_manager, enhanced_logger, file_operations, crawl_dwd)
- âœ… Architecture validated through DWD data analysis
- âœ… Timestamp-centric record format confirmed optimal
- âœ… Clean folder structure with organized components
- ðŸ”„ Ready for progress tracking and universal parser implementation

## Current Focus: Phase 1A Implementation
**Immediate Priority:** Complete progress tracking foundation before core processing pipeline

### Task 1: Progress Tracker Implementation
- SQLite-based file processing log (file_processing_log table)
- Checkpoint/resume functionality for 1,623+ files
- Thread-safe operations for 4 parallel workers
- Progress reporting (completion %, ETA, throughput)

### Task 2: Enhanced Logger Completion  
- Component-based logging codes (BULK_001, PARSE_002, etc.)
- Performance metrics integration
- Memory usage tracking
- Multi-target output (console, file, structured JSON)

## Architecture Context
- **Sequential Datasets + Parallel Workers** approach confirmed
- **Universal Parser** strategy for DWD complexity handling
- **Fail-Fast** behavior: any worker failure stops dataset processing
- **Resource Limits:** 512MB per worker, 4 workers max, 2GB total

## Success Criteria for Current Phase
- Process 100 test files with full progress tracking
- Memory monitoring shows <512MB per worker
- Complete error recovery from mid-processing failures
- All logging provides actionable debugging information

## Next Phase Preview
After progress tracking completion:
- File Process Worker implementation (worker pool system)
- Universal Parser System (update legacy raw_parser.py)
- Integration testing with 10-minute air temperature dataset

## Key Files for Implementation Context

- `app/context/coding_patterns.py` 
- `app/context/processor_interface.py`
- `current_task.md` (this file)

**Key Changes Made:**
1. **Updated status** to reflect completed foundational work
2. **Clarified current focus** on progress tracking as immediate priority
3. **Added specific implementation tasks** with technical details
4. **Included architecture context** from validated decisions
5. **Updated success criteria** to be more specific and measurable
6. **Added next phase preview** for continuity
7. **Listed context files** for implementation chat reference

This updated file now accurately reflects where you are in the project and provides clear guidance for the implementation chat on what needs to be built next.
