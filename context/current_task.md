# Current Development Phase: Progress Tracking Foundation

## Project Status (Updated 2025-07-25)

- ‚úÖ Foundational utilities completed (config_manager, enhanced_logger, file_operations, crawl_dwd)
- ‚úÖ Architecture validated through DWD data analysis
- ‚úÖ Timestamp-centric record format confirmed optimal
- ‚úÖ Clean folder structure established
- üîÑ **Current Focus:** Progress tracking system implementation
- ‚è≥ **Next:** Translation manager and universal parser system


## Immediate Priority: Progress Tracker Implementation

### Core Requirements

- **SQLite-based tracking** for 500K+ files across multiple datasets
- **Resume capability** after crashes, interruptions, or manual stops
- **Thread-safe coordination** for up to 4 parallel workers
- **Atomic operations** to prevent race conditions and data corruption
- **Performance optimized** for large-scale bulk processing


### Database Schema

Table: `file_processing_log`

- Track file status: pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completed/failed
- Worker coordination and claim management
- Timing and performance metrics
- Error tracking and recovery information


### Integration Requirements

- Use existing `config_manager` for database path configuration
- Integrate with `enhanced_logger` using component code "PROG"
- Follow established error handling and resource cleanup patterns
- Support configuration via `base_config.yaml`


## Architecture Context

- **Sequential Datasets + Parallel Workers** approach
- **Fail-Fast** behavior: worker failure stops dataset processing
- **Resource Limits:** 512MB per worker, 4 workers max, 2GB total
- **File Scale:** 1,623 files for 10min air temp, 500K+ total across all datasets


## Success Criteria for Progress Tracker

- Handle 1,623 air temperature files with full status tracking
- Resume processing after simulated interruption without data loss
- Support 4 concurrent workers without blocking or race conditions
- Query operations complete in <1 second even with 500K+ records
- Memory usage <50MB for tracking database operations


## Implementation Constraints

- Database location: `data/progress_tracking.db`
- Must handle SQLite concurrency safely (WAL mode, proper locking)
- All operations must be atomic and recoverable
- Comprehensive logging of all database operations and status changes


## Next Phase Preview

After progress tracker completion:

- Translation Manager implementation (metadata enrichment)
- Universal Parser System (raw DWD file processing)
- Dataset Processor integration (complete pipeline assembly)
