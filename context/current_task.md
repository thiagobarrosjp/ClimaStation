# Current Development Phase: Universal Parser Implementation

## Project Status (Updated 2025-07-28)

- ‚úÖ Foundational utilities completed (config_manager, enhanced_logger, file_operations, crawl_dwd)
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking system completed + comprehensive testing
- ‚úÖ Translation Manager completed + comprehensive testing
- ‚úÖ Architecture validated through DWD data analysis
- üîÑ **Current Focus:** Universal Parser implementation
- ‚è≥ **Next:** Dataset Processor integration and bulk processing pipeline


## Immediate Priority: Universal Parser Implementation

### Core Requirements

- **Raw DWD file parsing** with support for various formats and encodings
- **Data validation** and quality code preservation
- **Timestamp-centric record generation** using translation manager
- **Integration** with progress tracker and translation systems


### Universal Parser Components

- `app/shared/universal_parser.py` - Core parsing logic
- Support for DWD semicolon-delimited format
- German encoding handling (ISO-8859-1, UTF-8)
- Integration with existing translation and progress tracking


### Success Criteria for Universal Parser

- Parse 1,623 air temperature files with full data extraction
- Generate timestamp-centric records with translated metadata
- Handle encoding issues and malformed data gracefully
- Integrate with progress tracker for processing workflow
- Memory efficient processing (<512MB per worker)
