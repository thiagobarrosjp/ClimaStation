# Current Development Phase: Core Infrastructure Rebuild

## Project Status
- Folder structure cleaned and organized
- Legacy code moved to _legacy/ 
- Current scripts have broken dependencies
- No functional pipeline at the moment

## Phase 1 Objectives
- Rebuild core utilities following new architecture
- Implement clean processor interfaces
- Establish working orchestrator pipeline
- Target: Process 10-minute air temperature dataset (1,623 files)

## Key Constraints
- Memory usage < 2GB total
- File-level progress tracking required
- Must handle processing failures gracefully
- Follow dependency injection patterns

## Success Criteria
- All 1,623 historical files processed successfully
- Clean, maintainable code following established patterns
- Ready to scale to other datasets
