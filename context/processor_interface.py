"""
ClimaStation Dataset Processor Interface (Reference Only)

SCRIPT IDENTIFICATION: (interface-only)

PURPOSE:
Defines the `IDatasetProcessor` interface and `ProcessingResult` dataclass
used by all dataset processing modules in the ClimaStation pipeline.

This file serves as a REFERENCE for implementation. It MUST NOT be imported
or executed at runtime.

RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Provide a standard interface contract for all processing components
- Define the expected output structure via `ProcessingResult`
- Support typing and IDE auto-completion for implementation modules

USAGE:
    # Do NOT import or call this module directly!
    # Refer to it when implementing a processor, e.g.:
    class MyProcessor(IDatasetProcessor):
        def process_files(...): ...
        def validate_file(...): ...

PROTECTION:
This file will raise an ImportError if imported during runtime to prevent misuse.
